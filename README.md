## 4 games
You can play up to four games: Connect4, Commplicaica, Gravity and Reversi. Each game have different mechanics.
* Connect4: the objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. 
* Complica: the objetive is the same as Connect 4. However, we have include a new feature. Now if you try to put a disc on a full column, the column moves down and your disc is placed on top.
* Gravity: In the game, whenever you place a disc on the board, it's automatically moves to the neareaset walls. That's because We have applied some "gravity" stuff.
* Reversi: The game is won by the player who has more discs of their color.

### Automatic players.
Are you bored and nobody want to play with you? No problem! We've created an awesome feature that allows you to use an "automatic player" that will place a disc in a position of the board.
