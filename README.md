# Java Games x4
javaGamesx4 is a platform created on java where you can play up to 4 funny and addictive games.

### Up to four games!
You can play up to four games: Connect4, Commplicaica, Gravity and Reversi. Each game have different mechanics.
* Connect4: the objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. 
* Complica: the objetive is the same as Connect 4. However, we have include a new feature. Now if you try to put a disc on a full column, the column moves down and your disc is placed on top.
* Gravity: In the game, whenever you place a disc on the board, it's automatically moves to the neareaset walls. That's because We have applied some "gravity" stuff.
* Reversi: The game is won by the player who has more discs of their color.

### Automatic players.
Are you bored and nobody want to play with you? No problem! We've created an awesome feature that allows you to use an "automatic player" that will place a disc in a position of the board.

### Fast and safe.
We've devoted tons of time and resources to create as better algorithms as we can program. We think our platform is fast, save and without bugs. However, if you find some bugs, please open an issue or send an email to <dividirporcero@gmail.com>. Thanks!
