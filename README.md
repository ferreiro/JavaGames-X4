# Java Games x4
GamesX4 is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) program on Java to play up to 4 addictive Games.

### Hours of fun guaranteed. Choose your Game!
You can play up to four nice and funny games: Connect4, Complica, Gravity and Reversi. Each game have different mechanics (the most difficult one is the Gravity :P).

* **Connect4**: join four disks of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. 
* **Complica**: similar as the Connect4. But now, if you try to put a disc on a full column, the column moves down and your disc is placed on top.
* **Gravity**: Whenever you place a disc on the board, it's automatically moves to the nearest wall. Yes... The name comes from the well known film Gravity :P. Fell the gravity!!! 
* **Reversi**: The most extremThe game is won by the player who has more discs of their color.

### Automatic players.
Are you bored because nobody wants to play with you? No problem! We've created an awesome feature that allows you to use an "automatic player" that will place a disc in a position of the board.
